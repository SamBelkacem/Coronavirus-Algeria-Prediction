## Description
In this work, we first trained a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria. Then, to better understand the spread of the virus, we constructed a dataset from different reliable sources and conducted a large-scale data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide.

## Python code
The Python Jupyter Notebook to read and visualize the data and the code is available on [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/SamBelkacem/Coronavirus-Algeria-Prediction/blob/main/Coronavirus%20-%20Algeria-Prediction.ipynb).
